## Special Directories

You can create the following extra directories, some of which have special behaviors. Only `pages` is required; you can delete them if you don't want to use their functionality.

### `assets`

The assets directory contains your uncompiled assets such as Stylus or Sass files, images, or fonts.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/assets).

### `components`

The components directory contains your Vue.js components. Components make up the different parts of your page and can be reused and imported into your pages, layouts and even other components.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/components).

### `layouts`

`<Nuxt/>` 는 `<RouterView/>` 와 동일한 역할
레이아웃 폴더 안에 `<Nuxt/>` 를 지정해주면 라우터가 해당 url에 맞게 페이지 폴더안 vue 파일 핸들링
### `pages`

페이지 폴더 안에 `*.vue` 생성시 파일 기반의 자동 라우팅 생성


```bash
# .nuxt/router.js
export const routerOptions = {
  mode: 'history',
  base: '/',
  linkActiveClass: 'nuxt-link-active',
  linkExactActiveClass: 'nuxt-link-exact-active',
  scrollBehavior,

  routes: [{
    # main.vue 파일 추가시 자동 생성
    path: "/main",
    component: _97f29cac,
    name: "main"
  }, {
    path: "/",
    component: _a377409e,
    name: "index"
  }],

  fallback: false
}
```

### `plugins`

The plugins directory contains JavaScript plugins that you want to run before instantiating the root Vue.js Application. This is the place to add Vue plugins and to inject functions or constants. Every time you need to use `Vue.use()`, you should create a file in `plugins/` and add its path to plugins in `nuxt.config.js`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/plugins).

### `static`

This directory contains your static files. Each file inside this directory is mapped to `/`.

Example: `/static/robots.txt` is mapped as `/robots.txt`.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/static).

### `store`

This directory contains your Vuex store files. Creating a file in this directory automatically activates Vuex.

More information about the usage of this directory in [the documentation](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/directory-structure/store).
